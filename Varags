// Varags enables us to write multiple arguments for same  function
// Suppose you want to add tow numbers you create a method and with help of main method you print it 
// If you want to add one more number you again make one new method and again in main method you print new line
// You are repeating the code here instead you can use varags 
// it cretes your entered elements into arrays
